# dsg-project
The aim of this project is to create a Music Classifier which can classify any snippet of music into 10 genres namely; blues, classical, country, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae and rock.
I have used the GTZAN dataset for Music Genre Classification from kaggle for this project. It contains 10 genres with 100 audio files of 30s length for each. It also has visual representations of all these samples in the form of Mel-Spectrograms. I have used CNN to classify these spectrograms into their respective genres. I have currently achieved an accuracy of 25 % and am in the process of making further improvements to my model to increase the accuracy,
